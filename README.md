# Citadel CLI

A keyboard-first command console for the power users of your web apps.

# Use Cases

- **API Testing & Debugging**: Execute REST calls, inspect responses, and manipulate cookies/localStorage without leaving your
application context
- **Power User Workflows**: Transform repetitive click-through sequences into fast keyboard commands for advanced users
- **DevOps Integration**: Add command-line control to CI/CD dashboards and deployment tools for rapid operations
- **Internal Tool Enhancement**: Give your team's web applications the speed and efficiency of terminal interfaces
- Perform (multiple) REST API calls & view results, view/modify cookies/localstorage. Do JavaScript things without affecting the application.

# Installation

```bash
npm i citadel_cli
```

## "Hello world" Example

A core concept in Citadel are commands. Commands are things like "user add 1234"
or "qa1 deploy my_feature_branch". To initialize and add commands:

1. Create a `CommandRegistry` instance
2. Add one or more commands to that registry
3. Pass the registry to `Citadel`

```typescript
import {
  Citadel,
  CommandRegistry,
  TextCommandResult,
} from "citadel_cli";

// 1. Create the registry
const registry = new CommandRegistry();

// 2. Add commands
registry.addCommand(
  [
    { type: "word", name: "greet" },
    { type: "argument", name: "name", description: "Who are we greeting?" },
  ],
  "Say hello to someone", // Description used by the built-in `help` command
  async (args: string[]) => new TextCommandResult(`Hello ${args[0]} world!`)
);

// 3. Pass the registry to the component
function App() {
  return <Citadel commandRegistry={registry} />;
}
```

## Command Expansion

Citadel CLI uses **auto-expansion** to make entering commands as fast as
possible. When you type the first letter of a command it automatically expands
to the full word. For the above example, typing <kbd>g</kbd> would expand
in-place to `greet ` (with a trailing space) whereupon you can enter in a value
for the `name` argument.

## `addCommand` Details

The `addCommand` method has the following signature:

```typescript
addCommand(segments: CommandSegment[], description: string, handler: CommandHandler): void
```

`segments[]` - Each `CommandSegment` in this array consists of a `type` (one of
"word" or "argument"), a `name`, and an optional `description`

`description` - Description of the command itself. Used by the built-in help
command

`handler` - What gets executed when <kbd>Enter</kbd> is pressed. The handler
must return one of the following:

- `TextCommandResult`
- `JsonCommandResult`
- `ImageCommandResult`
- `ErrorCommandResult`

### Arguments

1. Each command can have zero or more arguments
2. Argument values are passed to the handler as a `String[]`
3. Arguments can be single- or double-quoted

### Example Handlers

Clearing localstorage:

```
  async () => {
    localStorage.clear();
    return new TextCommandResult('localStorage cleared!');
  }
```

Make an HTTP POST with a body containing a given `name`:

```
async (args: string[]) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/endpoint', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ name: args[0] }),
  });
  return new JsonCommandResult(await response.json());
}
```


## Configuration

Certain configuration options can be passed to the Citadel component. These are
given below, along with their default values.

```
const config = {
  commandTimeoutMs: 10000,
  includeHelpCommand: true,
  maxHeight: '80vh',
  initialHeight: '40vh',
  minHeight: '200',
  outputFontSize: '0.875rem',
  resetStateOnHide: false,
  showCitadelKey: '.',
  cursorType: 'blink', // 'blink', 'spin', 'solid', or 'bbs'
  cursorSpeed: 530,
  storage: {
    type: 'localStorage',
    maxCommands: 100
  }
};
```

Then to make the component aware of them:

```
<Citadel commandRegistry={cmdRegistry} config={config} />
```
