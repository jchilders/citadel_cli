I am building an implementation of the command registry pattern in JavaScript. The intent is for the parsing of text entered into a prompt, similar to zsh with command completion turned on. What is allowed to be entered, however, is limited to what is provided in a configuration file.

The structure is hierarhical, with commands at the top level and subcommands or arguments at any level. Each command or argument has a description and an optional handler.

The specific rules are for the configuration file are:

1. The top level entries must be commands (i.e.: no arguments at the top level)
2. Commands at any level can have zero or one arguments
3. Each command or argument has a required `description`
4. Each command or argument has an optional `handler`

I need an interface definition for the configuration file based on the above requirements.
