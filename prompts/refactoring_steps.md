I'll analyze this component from a modern React/TypeScript perspective and provide a structured list of refactoring steps. Each of these could be used as individual prompts for specific improvements.


1. Split State Management - DONE
Extract all state management into a custom hook (e.g., useCitadelState)
Consider using a reducer pattern given the complex state interactions
Prompt: "Help me extract all state management from the Citadel component into a custom hook using useReducer"

2. Command Processing Logic Separation - DONE
Move command-related functions (getAvailableCommands, executeCommand, etc.) into a separate service/hook
Create a dedicated command processor service
Prompt: "Help me create a separate CommandProcessor service/hook for all command-related logic"

3. Keyboard Handling Hook - DONE
Extract the large keyboard event handler into its own hook (useCitadelKeyboard)
Split different key handlers into separate functions
Prompt: "Help me create a separate keyboard handling hook for the Citadel component"

4. UI Component Breakdown - DONE
Split into smaller components:
CommandOutput (for the output section)
CommandInput (for the input section)
CommandSuggestions (for available commands)
ArgumentHelp (for argument descriptions)
Prompt: "Help me break down the Citadel component's UI into smaller, focused components"

5. Response Formatting Logic
Move formatResponse into a separate utility
Consider creating a dedicated ResponseFormatter class/service
Prompt: "Help me extract and improve the response formatting logic into a separate utility"

6. Type Definition Organization - DONE
Move types to a separate types file
Create proper interfaces for all props
Add proper generic types where applicable
Prompt: "Help me organize and improve the TypeScript types for the Citadel component"

7. Command Configuration Architecture - DONE
Create a proper command registry pattern
Implement proper command builder pattern
Prompt: "Help me implement a proper command registry pattern for managing commands"

8. Animation and Styling
Extract animation logic into custom hooks
Move styles to a separate styled-components or CSS module
Prompt: "Help me separate styling and animation concerns from the main component"

9. Performance Optimization
Implement proper memoization
Add virtualization for large command lists
Optimize re-renders
Prompt: "Help me optimize the performance of the Citadel component"

10. Testing Infrastructure
Set up proper test structure
Add unit tests for each extracted component/hook
Add integration tests for the full component
Prompt: "Help me create a comprehensive testing strategy for the Citadel component"

11. Error Handling and Validation
Implement proper error boundaries
Create consistent error handling patterns
Improve validation feedback
Prompt: "Help me implement proper error handling and validation patterns"

12. Accessibility Improvements
Add proper ARIA labels
Implement keyboard navigation patterns
Ensure proper focus management
Prompt: "Help me make the Citadel component fully accessible"
