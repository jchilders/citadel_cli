# Story S1.1 - Implement Basic Command History Storage

## Description
As a user, I want my previously entered commands to be stored so that I can access them later.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1. Enable Storage Configuration
Must Support:
- Storage type selection (localStorage/memory)
- Default to localStorage
- Storage limit configuration
Manual Verification:
- Configuration options are recognized
- Default settings are applied when not specified
- Storage limit value is respected
Prerequisite: None
Developer Notes:
- Consider adding storage configuration to existing config interface
- Include reasonable default values for storage limits
- Keep storage type selection flexible for future storage types

### Step 2. Enable Basic Storage Operations
Must Support:
- Adding new commands to storage
- Retrieving stored commands
- Maintaining command order
Manual Verification:
- New commands are successfully stored
- Retrieved commands match stored commands
- Command order is preserved
Prerequisite: Step 1
Developer Notes:
- Implement basic storage operations independently of storage type
- Ensure commands are stored with timestamps
- Consider implementing a storage interface for consistency

### Step 3. Enable localStorage Implementation
Must Support:
- Saving commands to localStorage
- Loading commands from localStorage
- Handling localStorage errors
Manual Verification:
- Commands persist after page refresh
- Commands are available in new sessions
- Storage continues working if localStorage is full
Prerequisite: Step 2
Developer Notes:
- Include error handling for localStorage operations
- Consider data format for stored commands
- Handle storage quota exceeded scenarios

### Step 4. Enable Memory Storage Implementation
Must Support:
- In-memory command storage
- Command retrieval from memory
- Storage limit enforcement
Manual Verification:
- Commands are stored in memory
- Commands can be retrieved from memory
- Oldest commands are removed when limit is reached
Prerequisite: Step 2
Developer Notes:
- Implement efficient memory storage structure
- Consider memory usage optimization
- Ensure proper cleanup of old entries

### Step 5. Enable Storage Fallback Mechanism
Must Support:
- Detection of localStorage availability
- Automatic switching to memory storage
- Preservation of existing commands during switch
Manual Verification:
- System detects when localStorage is unavailable
- Seamless transition to memory storage
- No command loss during storage type switch
Prerequisite: Steps 3 and 4
Developer Notes:
- Implement robust availability detection
- Handle edge cases during storage switching
- Ensure transparent operation for users
