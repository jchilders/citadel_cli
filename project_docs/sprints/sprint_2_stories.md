Story S2.1: Implement Command History Execution
As a user, I want to execute commands directly from my command history so that I can easily rerun previous commands.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Commands can be executed directly from history by selecting them
- Command arguments are preserved exactly as they were in the original execution
- Executed commands are added to the history as new entries
- Error handling for invalid or stale commands in history
- Up/Down arrows navigate through history
- Enter executes the currently selected command
- Escape clears the current selection
- Current input is preserved when starting navigation

Dependencies: S1.1, S1.2

Developer Notes:
- Add executeHistoryCommand method to HistoryService
- Update useCommandHistory hook to support command execution
- Integrate with existing keyboard event handling
- Add tests for command execution and navigation
- Consider edge cases (empty history, partial input)

Technical Rationale: This enables users to efficiently rerun previous commands, a core feature of command history functionality.

Story S2.2: Implement Command History Persistence
As a user, I want my command history to persist across browser sessions so that I can access my command history even after restarting.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Command history survives browser refresh
- History is preserved across browser sessions
- Implement maximum history size limit
- Clear history option that persists across sessions
- Migration strategy for existing history data
- Graceful handling of storage quota exceeded

Dependencies: S1.1

Developer Notes:
- Extend StorageFactory to handle persistence
- Add versioning for history data structure
- Implement cleanup strategy for old history entries
- Add tests for persistence scenarios
- Consider compression for large history datasets

Technical Rationale: Persistent history storage ensures users maintain their command history context across sessions.

Story S2.3: Add Command Validation for History Execution
As a user, I want commands from history to be validated before execution so that I don't run invalid or stale commands.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Validate command exists before execution
- Check if command arguments are still valid
- Clear error messages for invalid commands
- Option to skip validation (with warning)
- Validation status shown in UI
- Documentation of validation rules

Dependencies: S2.1

Developer Notes:
- Add validation methods to CommandTrie
- Consider caching validation results
- Add validation state to history items
- Add tests for various validation scenarios

Technical Rationale: Validation prevents errors from executing commands that may no longer be valid in the current context.
